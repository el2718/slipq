# Slip-Squashing Factors

Slip-squashing factors $Q_\mathrm{sf}$ and $Q_\mathrm{sb}$ ([Titov_2009_ApJ_693_1029](https://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.1088/0004-637X/693/1/1029)) are defined by two field line mappings and two boundary flow mappings between two instants; their large values define the surfaces that border of the reconnected or to-be-reconnected magnetic flux tubes for a given period of time during the magnetic evolution. 

For the case of static boundaries, we can compute the slip-squashing factors using the coordinate mapping provided by FastQSL. Following the initial coordinate mapping within the first magnetic field, the resulting mapped coordinates can be served as a seed grid for applying FastQSL to the second magnetic field. 

This program can be downloaded with the command
```
git clone https://github.com/par2solarwind
```

And FastQSL2 should be downloaded first
```
git clone https://github.com/FastQSL2
```
